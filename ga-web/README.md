# Build
Make you have `cargo make` and `npm` installed and you are running either Linux or WSL. Building using another OS is untested.

Just run `cargo make full-build-flow`. This will install the remaining buildtools needed and build the entire site in `www/pkg`.

If you want to run a dev server, use `cargo make run`
